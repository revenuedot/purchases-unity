> [!NOTE]
> **Fork of RevenueCat's MIT SDK, maintained by RevenueDot, not affiliated with RevenueCat.** It keeps the upstream public API (`Purchases.configure`, `Purchases.shared`, every class and method name), so app code and RevenueCat's guides work unchanged. It talks to [RevenueDot](https://github.com/revenuedot/revenuedot) at `https://api.revenuedot.app` by default (`setProxyURL` still points it at a self-hosted server) and verifies RevenueDot's response signatures. RevenueCat's copyright notice is kept in `LICENSE`. Patches: [scripts/forks](https://github.com/revenuedot/revenuedot/tree/main/scripts/forks). **Status: publishing to package registries is in progress.**
>
> **Install:** OpenUPM `com.revenuedot.purchases-unity`, or the `Purchases.unitypackage` from this repo's releases. C# namespaces are unchanged. EDM4U pulls `RevenueDotPurchasesHybridCommon` (CocoaPods) and `app.revenuedot.purchases:purchases-hybrid-common` (Maven).
>
> The upstream README follows, unchanged. Where it says RevenueCat's dashboard or API, use RevenueDot's.

## Dependencies and Unity IAP
We use StoreKit for iOS and BillingClient for Android. This plugin also depends on [purchases-ios](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios), [purchases-android](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android) and [purchases-hybrid-common](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-hybrid-common).
